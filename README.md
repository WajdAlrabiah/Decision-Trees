# Decision Trees

This project demonstrates how **Decision Trees** can classify data and visualize decision boundaries using **scikit-learn**.  
It includes experiments on the **Iris dataset** and a **synthetic moon-shaped dataset** to explore how tree parameters affect model complexity and generalization.

---

## Project Overview
The notebook walks through:
1. Loading and preparing the Iris dataset  
2. Building and visualizing a Decision Tree classifier  
3. Drawing decision boundaries  
4. Comparing different tree configurations using:
   - `max_depth`
   - `min_samples_leaf`
   - `max_leaf_nodes`
5. Evaluating the impact of model parameters on overfitting and underfitting

## Libraries Used
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

---

## Key Concepts
- Decision Tree construction and visualization  
- Control of model complexity using pruning parameters  
- Boundary plotting for classifier decision regions  
- Probability prediction for class membership

## Visual Outputs
The notebook generates and saves several visualizations:
- `decistion_tree_depth2.png` – Tree structure at depth 2  
- `decision_tree_decision_boundaries_plot.png` – Decision boundaries for Iris dataset  
- `min_samples_leaf_plot.png` – Comparison of models with different `min_samples_leaf` values  
- `max_leaf_nodesf_plot.png` – Comparison of models with various `max_leaf_nodes` limits

## Hello and Welcome

Thank you for visiting my GitHub page!  
I’m currently in the process of uploading my previous projects and doing my best to make them publicly available in an organized and clear manner.  

At the moment, I’m adding each project with some **light updates and clarifying adjustments**, and I plan to include more **comprehensive notes, explanations, and detailed READMEs** very soon — to help others better understand each project’s idea and usage.  

If you have any questions, suggestions, or would simply like to connect, I’d be delighted to hear from you:
